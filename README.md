# Smart-Lighting-System

Designed a lighting system for a conference hall as a part of the Microprocessors and Interfacing Course. 
This was done using the 8086 processor and the 8255 peripheral.
The lights for each row turn on when a person enters the hall. 
This is detected using IR sensors.
The lights remain on as long as there are people in the row. 
The lights go off when the entire row empties completely
